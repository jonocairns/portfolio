                "The following work is printed marketing collateral done while at South Sea Cruises and at CBRE. At South Sea Cruises I had the opportunity to do a large variety of this kind of work, from posters to magazine ads and brochures. The brands under South Sea Cruises Ltd were varied, and all had their own brand considerations including target demographic, colour palettes and look and feel. At CBRE, the challenge was taking what was often very dry information and presenting it in formats that were interesting and pleasing to look at, while still keeping with the brand guidelines."
