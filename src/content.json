            "I'm Ellie, a graphic designer with a background in several media design industries including 3D animation, film-making & post-production/VFX. My strengths lie in my communication skills and in lateral creative thinking. I'm fascinated with technology and really enjoy figuring out faster, more innovative ways to get things done. I'm a motivated team-player who thrives in a busy collaborative environment, but I am just as happy working on my own. Turning concepts into beautiful designs is my passion."
