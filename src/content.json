            "I’m a results-driven, passionate designer whose strength is in lateral creative thinking. I'm fascinated with technology and really enjoy figuring out faster, more innovative ways to get things done. I'm a big advocate of working smarter, not harder, and I enjoy a fast-paced, challenging environment. I work best with people in a collaborative team environment, but I'm just as happy working on my own. Plonk me in front of some creative software or give me a pencil & paper, and I'm happy. My favourite part of being a Graphic Designer is taking someone's specifications and making something out of them that looks awesome."
