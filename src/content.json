            "I’m a results-driven, passionate designer whose strength is in creative storytelling. I have experience in both corporate and creative design (both print & digital) and a strong background in marketing. As a bonus, I’m also trained in 3D animation, post-production, visual effects, production, and a variety of other creative fields. I also have a fair understanding of the software development industry and its processes. I enjoy a bit of anything creative, but eventually I want to end up either designing my heart out in a creative/advertising agency, or working in a 3D/Post production house as a character animator."
